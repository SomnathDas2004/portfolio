      <p>👋 Hi there! I'm Somnath Das, currently pursuing my Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) from RCC Institute of Information Technology. With a solid foundation in programming languages like C, Python, and SQL, as well as a growing familiarity with Linux systems and Windows also, I'm constantly exploring new horizons in the tech world.

        My passion lies in ☁️ cloud computing and DevOps, and I'm dedicated to expanding my knowledge and skills in these areas. I believe that the future of technology lies in leveraging the power of the cloud and adopting efficient DevOps practices to streamline development processes.
        
        Outside of the tech realm, you'll often find me on the ⚽ football field, honing my skills and enjoying the beautiful game. I'm also an avid 📸 photographer, always ready to capture life's memorable moments through my lens.
        
        I'm excited about the endless possibilities that technology offers and am eager to connect with like-minded professionals to collaborate and learn from each other. Let's connect and explore the exciting world of technology together! 🚀</p>
